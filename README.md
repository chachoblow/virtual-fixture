# virtual-fixture
A rogue-like game bulit with Java.

## Demo 
For a demo of the game, please see the video I made on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/C-yfkUNuN_M).

## Features
Features include: 
 - A pseudo-random (based of a user entered seed), procedurally generated cave system.
 - The use of Dijkstra's algorithm to implement the animation which signifies a switch between the virtual and physical world.
 - Ray casting which allows the user to discover the cave system.
 - Memory of seen cave sections. Once ray casting has lit up a part of the cave and the user leaves, that part of the cave will remain.
 - GUI which includes instructions, health, energies collected, and a dynamic available controls section.
