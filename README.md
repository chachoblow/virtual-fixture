# virtual-fixture
A rogue-like game bulit with Java.

## Demo 
For a demo of the game, please see the video I made on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/C-yfkUNuN_M).

## Features
Features include: 
 - A pseudo-random (based of a user entered seed), procedurally generated cave system.
 - The use of Dijkstra's algorithm to implement the animation which signifies a switch between the virtual and physical world.
 - Ray casting which allows the user to discover the cave system.
 - Memory of seen cave sections. Once ray casting has lit up a part of the cave and the user leaves, that part of the cave will remain.
 - GUI which includes instructions, health, energies collected, and a dynamic available controls section.
 
 ## Source Code
 If anyone would like to see source code for this project, please send me an email asking for it. Despite the game being entirely coded by me, this was created as a class project for CS61B at UC Berkeley. Thus, I must keep the source code private.
